                <p>As a data scientist, policy analyst, and civic technologist with a background in music education, I enjoy breaking down problems, scaling solutions, and communicating results to people who need them.</p>
                <p>I am very fortunate to have centered my career around both interesting and socially impactful problems. Currently, I am leveraging past experience to conduct quantitative research at the Consortium on School Research, provide predictive analytics for the Environmental Protection Agency, and forward the intersection of art and deep learning at the University of Chicago. </p>

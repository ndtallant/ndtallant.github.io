# Hello

I’m becoming a policy researcher / civic technologist / data guru at the University of Chicago – pursuing an MS in [Computational Analysis & Public Policy](https://capp.uchicago.edu/). Civic life today seems to have a lot of problems – and I’m having the time of my life trying to tackle them than with lots and lots of data.

This site is *in development*, as I am currently finishing up other projects, like the [Harris Data Census](https://ndtallant.github.io/DataCensus/).

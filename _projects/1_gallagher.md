I was fortunate for the opportunity to extend the [award winning](https://www.businessinsurance.com/article/20181104/NEWS08/912324896/Business-Insurance-2018-Innovation-Awards-SMART-Benchmark-Gallagher-Bassett) SMART paradigm to auto bodily injury claims at Gallagher Bassett - providing a vastly more accurate and useful system to benchmark their clientsâ€™ claims. 

Going beyond traditional analysis with internal data, I met with domain experts and collected government data to engineer rich feature sets for supervised learning tasks. Feature genreation was futher informed by an econometric analysis, which also identified key drivers of claim complexity for the industry. Final products included: a deployed predictive model, an automated reporting system, and a documented framework to train new models.

The infrastructure for potable water in the United States is reaching the end of its life, resulting in almost a quarter of a million water main breaks per year. While the replacement and maintenance of infrastructure is inevitable, the excess costs and risks of water main breaks are not. Ideal preventative maintenance would save municipalities the cost of lost water, construction wages, and property damage while minimizing the disruption of public life for its residents. 

A city that knows which water mains are at risk for breaking in the future can implement a proactive maintenance policy that works in parallel with other public infrastructure improvement projects, ultimately resulting in cost savings. This project delivered a tool to help municipalities achieve these policy goals. Specifically, a machine learning pipeline for classifying city blocks as “at risk of a water main break” or “not at risk of a water main break” within the next one, two, and three years.

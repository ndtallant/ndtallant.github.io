As a quantitative researcher for the [Consortium on School Research](https://consortium.uchicago.edu/), I evaluated the implementation of Common Core Math and Next Generation Science State Standards in Chicago Public Schools. The resulting analysis encompassed performance of about 400,000 students, differences between over 500 schools’ organizational capacities, professional development available to teachers, and a decade of direct feedback from teachers and students. 

This work will be used within the district to improve students’ classroom engagement and post-secondary outcomes, as well as inform future efforts to implement standards in urban school districts across the country.

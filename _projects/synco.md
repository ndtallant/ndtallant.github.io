As a former full-time musician, I was very eager to bring that domain knowledge into the the tech space. The result was syncopython, a text-based drum machine. Using prompt-toolkit, this shell application allows the user to enter in rhythms and get immediate midi output through their speakers.  

This fun project was my creation for the [ChiPy mentorship program](https://chipymentor.org/), where I received personal mentorship, group instruction, and many friends.

Extending the [award winning](https://www.businessinsurance.com/article/20181104/NEWS08/912324896/Business-Insurance-2018-Innovation-Awards-SMART-Benchmark-Gallagher-Bassett) SMART paradigm to auto bodily injury claims, I provided Gallagher Bassett a vastly more accurate and useful system to benchmark their clientsâ€™ claims. This project encompassed every aspect of a data science task - even meeting with experts for domain knowledge and web-scraping publicly available data. More specifically I...

- Provided insights on claim complexity through econometric analysis (statsmodels)
- Predicted complexity targets with various supervised learning methods (Sci-Kit Learn)
- Conducted a geospatial analysis of business (QGIS, SQL Server spatial)
- Deployed the trained model with an automated reporting system (Flask)

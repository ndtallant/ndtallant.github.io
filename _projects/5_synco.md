My experience as a former drummer and music educator thrust itself into the the tech space as syncopython. This retro feeling text-based drum machine gives the user an interactive experience for midi rhythm creation. 

This fun project was my creation for the [ChiPy mentorship program](https://chipymentor.org/), where I received personal mentorship, group instruction, and many friends.

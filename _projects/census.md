This project was for the Harris School of Public Policy, commited to cultivating data driven policy makers. Their goal was facilitated in this project by creating a resource for sharing policy-relevant datasets that have been accumulated and used by researchers within the University Community. I handled both the structure and front-end of this website, interviewed researchers on their work with the data, and constructed use cases for each dataset in R and python. See the full project [here](/DataCensus/).

**Tools**: Jekyll, Bootstrap, R, python, scss
